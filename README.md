Soda is a programming language, which is mostly functional but with some oo-conecpts in mind. It's like the best of both worlds combined

No. As you might can see this repo is as good as empty to be 100% honest with you, at the moment of writing this readme it is fully empty :)

I might wanna get to this point in about 1-2 years from now (July 2021)
